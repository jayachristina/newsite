Create multiple Kuberenetes clusters in AWS cloud directly from the Github code repository using GitHub Actions

<!--more-->

In this solution pattern you will discover how an API First Approach provides the right framework to build microservices and APIs based systems. The stages of an API life cycle cover both the implementation life cycle and the management life cycle.

* The Implementation phase allows you to collaboratively design an API before determining and developing the various channels and applications that will use the API. The design-first approach advocates for designing the APIâ€™s contract before writing any code.

* The Management phase allows you to manage access to the implement APIs, measure consumption and also track utilization of the APIs to perhaps even monetize the APIs
